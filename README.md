Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the work I completed during my internship at Bharat Intern.

Project 1: Netflix Homepage Landing Page
One of the key projects I undertook was the recreation of the Netflix homepage landing page. This project involved implementing the front-end design and layout of the Netflix homepage, providing a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Through this project, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining valuable experience in web development.

Project 2: Temperature Converter Website
As part of my internship at Bharat Intern, I developed a Temperature Converter website. This web application allows users to seamlessly convert temperatures between different units, providing a practical and user-friendly solution. The project was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, emphasizing functionality and an intuitive user experience. This endeavor not only enhanced my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of web development principles.
